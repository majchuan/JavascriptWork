        diff of t i.e. <= t, so if the bucket for nums[i] already exist that means we already have a diff of <=t,
        as each bucket consist's of number with max diff in-btw them of t

        /* if we dont have the bucket for the number, it means we are getting numbers's whose difference
        btw them is > t,
        ex : if t = 2, then 1, 4, 15, 19 .... these are nubers which have diff btw then > t,
        so they will exist in different buckets

        as we have already discussed that if the bucket already existed we wont have come to this point, i.e.
        if we are looking for lesser bucket and greater bucket, we  can be sure of that those are the only numbers in that bucket,
        i.e. it unnecessay for any bucket to have more than 1 value

        for ex if t = 2, k = 4, the [1, 4, 5, 2]
        now in this as we get to 5 , we will already have an bucket .'. we will return true

        if t = 2, k = 4, [12, 4, 27, 2], buckets for each number --> [4, 1, 9, 0]
        then buckets for each number is different,
        so now we will look fir numbers in lesser and greater buckets, here
        when we come across number 2 (bucket = 0), we find that we have a greater bucket i.e. 4(bucket = 1)
        and 4 - 2 == 2 .'. return true

        but we can have a lesser / greater bucket , but not have the required difference btw them,
        as the in each bucket will have max difference of t, but different buckets can have any number of difference btw them,
        we only check for just lesser/just greater becase those are the only numbers whcih are whitin our reach of t difference, for ex :

        if t = 3,
        the bucket[0] = [0 --> 3],
            bucket[1] = [4 --> 7],
            bucket[2] = [8 --> 11]

            in the above example we can hope that if the just smaller/just greater bucket exist ,
            there might exist a number whose difference with our's will give <= t
